# ngx-toasty

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10+.

This project is simple port (copy/paste with copyright credit) from ng2-toasty [repository](https://github.com/akserg/ng2-toasty).

***Not*** all styles from the original repo have been ported, for my needs I only ported the styles for **bootstrap** only.

The usage of this new module is the same with all the same options.

You would serve the app the same way as any angular cli application, there is a module in the app called **ngx-toasty** which has all the code from the **original ng2-toasty repo**.

The app has 4 buttons to display messages for testing.
